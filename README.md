This was a website I did in high school as a graduating project years ago.
Unfortunately I lost the database creation file, so it is not possible anymore to show the exact results.
Still, the source code is here and so are the queries and the images I used.
There were many mistakes but I was still learning and it was still quite a nice project in my opinion.
To open the website in the browser, simply drag and drop index.html in the browser.
Alternatively, you could simply click on index.html and select the browser you want after you click on 'Open with'.
In this project there are some concepts such as Authorization, Session Management, (REST) API backend,
management of HTTP status codes in response to various request, and some knowledge of basic IT technology.
